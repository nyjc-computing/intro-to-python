Python made them really useful by giving them some methods (which other programming languages don’t implement in the same way), but they are otherwise just different representations of **data types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that it quickly gets unwieldy to juggle so many variables, so we started to group them into **data structures** instead. These data structures: `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, and `set` let us work on more data with fewer variable names to juggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make more complex programs, it makes sense to start to think about **objects** rather than data types and data structures. While other programming languages treat data types, data structures, and objects differently, Python implements them all as objects. For example, when you open a file for reading or writing, the file handle that you get is an object.\n",

    "These two methods seem very similar. Which is more important, and why do we need two?\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are called by Python when the functions `repr()` and `str()` are called. You have already been instroduced to `str()`, but not to `repr()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of `repr()`, as far as I can tell, is to get the “source code” of the object; to know how to create the same object in the Python shell. This is useful mainly for debugging, when the skimpy `print()` statements don’t give enough information or if you need to try creating that object in your test code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`str()`, on the other hand, is called when the `print()` function encounters an object that is not a `str`. That is why it can handle non-`str` types—provided they have a `__str__()` that can be called. So the main purpose of `str()` is to give a concise, simple representation of the object for printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `__str__()` is not implemented in an object, Python will check if the object has a `__repr__()` method and use that. But if `__repr__()` is not implemented, Python will just give the default representation (e.g. `<__main__.Line at 0x7fa0b05a97f0>`) without checking for a `__str__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, **you should always have a `__repr__()` method** for every object you create. If you need something different to use in `print()`, you can implement a `__str__()` method as well."
