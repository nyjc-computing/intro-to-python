    "# Reading CSV files\n",

    "**Prerequisites**: Basic Python, lists, dicts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of converting an object to text data is known as **serialisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of converting text data to an object is known as **deserialisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides modules to ease the serialisation of data to and deserialisation of data from commonly used formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most commonly used modules are `csv` and `json`. These are **text-based formats** that allow object data to be written out in readable text-based form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSV format\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSV** stands for **C**omma-**S**eparated **V**alues. This format is commonly used for table exports, for data science, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this format, data is stored in the form of rows.  \n",
    "Each text item in the row is separated by a comma.  \n",
    "Items with commas in them (e.g. names, addresses) must be double-quoted (i.e. \"\")  \n",
    "An optional header row may be placed at the top of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format example\n",
    "\n",
    "    student_name,enrollment_year,class\n",
    "    Student1,2020,2004\n",
    "    Student2,2020,2005\n",
    "    Student3,2020,2005\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the `csv` module: reader and writer\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv` module provides `reader()` and `writer()` function. These functions return an iterable object. An iterable is an object that can be looped over (e.g. with a `for` or `while` loop). A Python list is an iterable, but an iterable need not be a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "`open()` should be called with the optional argument `newline=''` (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/3191811 for a detailed explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Official documentation for csv module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html\n",

    "To read data from a .csv file as a list of rows:\n",

    "import csv\n",
    "with open('data.csv', 'r', newline='') as f:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the csv` module: DictReader and DictWriter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv` module also provides `DictReader` and `DictWriter` classes that makes it easy to obtain each row as a dictionary, with column headers as row keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading to list of dicts with `csv.DictReader`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
