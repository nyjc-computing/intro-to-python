    "\n",
    "2. A recursive function should call itself (**self-invocation**) when the base case is unmet.\n",
    "   - It should call itself with a different state, i.e. the input to the next function call should not be the same as the input for the current function call.\n",
    "   - Each successive recursive call should **reduce the input** (problem) to bring it *closer to the base case*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A recursive function should have a **return value** that enables the calling function (i.e. the \"parent\" function) to build up the final return value.\n",
    "   - It is much easier to think through the logic of recursion if the *return value has a consistent type*.\n",
