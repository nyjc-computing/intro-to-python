This programming guide for Python beginners is part of a guided lesson package for H2 Computing students, with a greater focus on programming methodology over Python feature coverage.

For exercises with a focus on learning Python features quickly, see [Intro to Python](https://github.com/nyjc-computing/intro-to-python).

The exercises are provided here, *sans* guidance.

## Lessons

The following topics are covered:

### Python fundamentals

1. **Introduction** [X]
   - `int`, `float`, and arithmetic operators
   - `bool` and comparison operators
   - `str`, the concatenation and repetition operators
   - output
2. **Abstraction** [X]
   - expressions and statements
   - constants
   - defining functions and parameters
   - variable scoping
3. **Selection** [X]
   - input
   - `if-elif-else`
   - logical operators
4. **Recursion** [X]
   - features of successful recursion
5. **Iteration** [X]
   - Conditional iteration with `while`
   - Fixed iteration with `for`
   - slicing
   - in-place vs out-of-place methods
6. **Data structures** [X]
   - Sequences using `list`
   - Mappings using `dict`
   - `list` vs `tuple` vs `str`
7. **Debugging** [X]
   - trace tables and `print()` statements
   - the `pdb` debugger
8. **Identity** and **mutability** [X]
   - Identity with the `id()` function
   - `==` vs `is`
9. **File IO**: working with files and directories [X]
   - getting file handles from `open()`
   - file modes: read, write, and append
10. Error handling with `try` [X]

### Getting things done

    - f-strings
    - tuple unpacking
    - `enumerate()`
    - `zip()`
    - `sorted()`
    - `reversed()`
    - in-place operators
12. Abstraction with **modules** [ ]
