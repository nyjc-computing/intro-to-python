    "## Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary search algorithm is a search algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n): the maximum time taken to return a result scales with log(n) instead of n. This is a much more efficient algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "The caveat here is that it only works on **sorted sequences**. It will return the wrong result for unsorted sequences.\n",

    "\n",
    "I am thinking of a number from 1 to 100 (inclusive of both). You have 7 tries to guess this number correctly. What is your strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your strategy is to always guess the middle number of the valid range, that's binary search!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm description\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, binary search is implemented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Track the valid range (e.g. with a `start` and `end` integer)\n",
    "2. Determine the middle index\n",
    "3. If the middle item is equal to the search value, return its index\n",
    "4. If the middle item is greater than or less than the search value, update the valid range\n",
    "5. Repeat from step 2 until the valid range is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
